<h1> C Language Reference Project</h1>
<p> Welcome to the my C Language Reference Project. The objective of this project is to provide a list of tutorials in the C language together with reference code for different structures and algorithms implemented in C. The purpose of this project is completely didactical, so most of the subject approached will be focused in the curriculum of a computer science bachelor. Nonetheless, content less or more advanced than graduation level may appear, but will be not expected previous knowledge in computer science for the most part of the content and the content of the whole project should be self-contained, at least this is the plan for now.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for take your timing reading this prologue. I hope this can project can help you in some way. So let's start.</p>
